Hi Kastu,

AI is about data, and the underlying database you choose will determine the performance, scalability, and success of your AI application. This webinar “AI Database Comparison: MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL and pgvector <https://em.mongodb.com/MTQ5LUNCSi0xMzYAAAGZ0oIL_jqJP1Jp_ZeJ5PdHryf8d8mb4aSxK4BsCNA63N1Jub7by0kcdrrsnItWwBuDXOCpvqY=>” compares MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and PostgreSQL with pgvector head to head. We’ll compare capabilities and walk you through the creation of a RAG app using both, so you can see how it’s done.

Join our Staff Developer Advocate Richmond Alake, for this exciting event on Tuesday, April 29th at 10am BST. Here’s what you’ll learn:


	- The strengths, limitations, and differences between PostgreSQL/pgvector and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
	- How to monitor critical AI metrics and optimize latency and throughput for RAG, AI agents, and agentic systems.
	- Insights and actionable strategies from industry professionals who’ve tackled real-world AI challenges. 



Plus, we’ll provide you with technical resources to guide you through your AI application development journey, so you can get hands-on with code.

Hello, kasturi_762194.

The series of Educational Rounds continues thanks to the support of the Neapolis University Pafos. They offer a BSc in Computer Science and AI with JetBrains Scholarships. Gain cutting-edge skills in AI and machine learning, preparing you for high-demand tech careers.

You are welcome to register and compete in Educational Codeforces Round 175. It starts on Thursday, February, 27, 2025 14:35 (UTC). The contest duration is 2 hours.

Register Now → The round will be rated for ratings up to 2100.

The goal of educational rounds is to practice and educate, rather than to compete. You can read the details in this post dedicated to them. In short:

* Not only problems, but also exercises can be used.
* Useful ideas will be reused to introduce them to a wider range of participants, even if they are well-known.
* Often the formal text of the statements.
* Rated for Div. 2, unrated for Div. 1.
* ICPC rules + 12-hour open hacking phase.

The allowed programming languages are C/C++, Pascal, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Go, D, JavaScript, Rust and Kotlin.

The round will be held on the rules of Educational Rounds, so read the rules (here) beforehand. The round will be for newcomers and participants from both divisions. But the difficulty of problems is for Div 2. Want to compete? Do not forget to register for the contest and check your handle on the registrants page. The registration will be open for the whole contest duration.

How to chat with Gemini

Try these tips to get the best responses from Gemini.

Give instructions, not keywords

Try telling Gemini who you want it to act like—a career coach, for  
example—then explain what you’re looking for, the same way you’d talk to a  
friend.

More context, better results

Give Gemini details and examples of writing styles or desired formats to  
get the highest quality results.

Refine in conversation

First response not quite what you’re looking for? Ask follow-up questions  
and guide Gemini to get the responses you want.

One conversation, many Gemini Extensions

Gemini connects with the Google apps and services you already know and love  
to pull the info you need directly in your chat.2

You are welcome to register and compete in Educational Codeforces Round 173. It starts on Tuesday, December, 24, 2024 14:35 (UTC). The contest duration is 2 hours.

Register Now → The round will be rated for ratings up to 2100.

The goal of educational rounds is to practice and educate, rather than to compete. You can read the details in this post dedicated to them. In short:

* Not only problems, but also exercises can be used.
* Useful ideas will be reused to introduce them to a wider range of participants, even if they are well-known.
* Often the formal text of the statements.
* Rated for Div. 2, unrated for Div. 1.
* ICPC rules + 12-hour open hacking phase.

The allowed programming languages are C/C++, Pascal, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Go, D, JavaScript, Rust and Kotlin.

The round will be held on the rules of Educational Rounds, so read the rules (here) beforehand. The round will be for newcomers and participants from both divisions. But the difficulty of problems is for Div 2. Want to compete? Do not forget to register for the contest and check your handle on the registrants page. The registration will be open for the whole contest duration.
